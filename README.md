# IIRFilterDesign
Generate IIR Low Pass Filter with difference equation format. (MATLAB code)
You may make use of the coefficient to your code.

Edit the below variable along with your intention.

fc = 20;  %Hz Cutoff frequency
fa = 2*fc;  %Hz Attenuation frequency
Ma = -10;    % dB Attenuation magnitude
fs = 200;    %Hz Sampling frequency

This code also plots the position of poles which should be inside of a radius 1 circle.
